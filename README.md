## Gus Powell

I like to think of myself as an all-rounded individual, with a drive to succeed and an enthusiasm for tech and the industry that surrounds it. Having recentely graduated from university, I embarked on the whirlwind journey that is Makers Academy and learning to code. The most important thing for me now is to work in a forward thinking, agile company that provides the oppertunity to learn and contribute to the success of the business.
